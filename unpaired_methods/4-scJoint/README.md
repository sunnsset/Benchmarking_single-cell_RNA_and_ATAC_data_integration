# scJoint

scJoint is a transfer learning method to integrate atlas-scale, heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. scJoint leverages information from annotated scRNA-seq data in a semi-supervised framework and uses a neural network to simultaneously train labeled and unlabeled data, enabling label transfer and joint visualization in an integrative framework. For more information, please see scJoint manuscript: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.31.424916.
 

scJoint is developed using `PyTorch` 1.0.0 and has been tested under both  `PyTorch` 1.0.0 and 1.4.0. scJoint requires 1 GPU to run.

## Installation

scJoint can be obtained by simply clonning the github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/SydneyBioX/scJoint.git
```

The following python packages are required to be installed before running scJoint:
`h5py`, `torch`, `itertools`, `scipy`, `numpy`,  `os`, `random`, `sys`, `time`, and `datetime`.


## Preparing intput for scJoint

scJoint's main function takes expression data in `.npz` format and cell type labels in `.txt`  format. To prepare the input for scJoint, modifying dataset paths in `process_db.py` which:

1. take `.h5` files of expression matrix stored in `matrix/data` as input and generate `.npz` files for each expression matrix.
2. transform `.csv` files of cell type labels to numeric and stored in `.txt` files; and output `label_to_idx.txt` file indicates the correpondence of the numeric labels and the cell type labels.

Note:

1. The expression matrix for scRNA-seq data are the gene expression matrix (either normalised or raw data), and gene actvitiy matrix for scATAC-seq data.
2. The cell type labels for scRNA-seq is required, while the labels for scATAC-seq is optional and will only be used in accuracy calculation.

## Running scJoint

Edit `config.py` according to the data input (See Arguments section for more details).

In terminal, run

```
python main.py
```

The output will be saved in `./output` folder.


## Arguments

The script `config.py` indicate the arguments for scJoint, which needs to be modified according to the data.

### Dataset information

+ `DB`: name of the study
+ `number_of_class`: Number of cell type in the training data (scRNA-seq data)
+ `input_size`: Number of genes in both training and test data
+ `rna_paths`: A list of file paths of the .npz files of scRNA-seq gene expression datasets
+ `rna_labels`: A list of file paths of the .txt files of scRNA-seq cell type inforamtion
+ `atac_paths`: A list of file paths of the .npz files of scATAC-seq gene activity expression datasets
+ `atac_labels`: A list of file paths of the .txt files of scATAC-seq cell type inforamtion (optional, if `atac_labels` are provided, accuracy after knn would be provided)
+ `rna_protein_paths`: A list of paths of the .npz files of protein expression data for CITE-seq data (optional)
+ `atac_protein_paths`: A list of paths of the .npz files of protein expression data for ASAP-seq data (optional)

### Training config

+ `use_cuda`: Whether GPU is used
+ `threads`: Number of threads used (set as 1 by default)

+ `batch_size`: Batch size (set as 256 by default)
+ `lr_stage1`: Learning rate for stage 1
+ `lr_stage3`: Learning rate for stage 3
+ `lr_decay_epoch`: Number of epoch learning rate decay
+ `epochs_stage1`: Number of epochs for stage 1
+ `epochs_stage3`: Number of epochs for stage 3
+ `p`: The fraction of data pairs expected to have high cosine similarity scores (set as 0.8 by default)
+ `embedding_size`: Number of nodes in the embedding (hidden) layer (set as 64 by default)
+ `momentum`: Momentum for SGD (set as 0.9 by default)
+ `center_weight`: The weight for center loss (set as 1 by default)
+ `with_crossentorpy`: `True` indicates well differentiated cell type mode, `False` indicates to run trajectory mode of scJoint.
+ `seed`: seed to be used (set as none by default)

The configuration we used in our paper can be found in [link](https://github.com/sydneybiox/scJoint/blob/main/tutorial/config_notes.ipynb).

## Output

scJoint will output 4 types of .txt files: 

+ `_embeddings.txt`: Output of embeddings layer for each dataset
+ `_knn_predictions.txt`: Predicted results of KNN for each scATAC-seq data (final predictions), where the numeric corresponding to the label_to_idx.txt file.
+ `_knn_probs.txt`: Probability of KNN predictions for each scATAC-seq data
+ `_predictions.txt`: Output of prediction layer for each dataset



## Visualisation

To generate tSNE and UMAP plots for the output data using R, run the following codes in terminal

```
Rscript embedding_visualisation_R.R --output_dir output/ --input_dir data/ --TSNE TRUE --UMAP TRUE --proportion 1
```

where

+ `output_dir`: Directory of the output folder
+ `input_dir`: Directory of intput folder (where the label_to_idx.txt file is saved)
+ `TSNE`: TRUE/FALSE indicates whether to run TSNE 
+ `UMAP`: TRUE/FALSE indicates whether to run UMAP 
+ `Proportion`: proprotion of cells used in visualisation

Note: 

+ The script assumes the output folder only have results from one study
+ Please install the following packages before running the `embedding_visualisation_R.R` script by running the following codes in R:

```
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "ggthemes", "scattermore", "ggpubr", "Rtsne", "uwot", "pals", "grDevices", "optparse"))
```

Output of `embedding_visualisation_R.R`: 

+ TSNE and/or UMAP embedding will be generating in the `output_dir` folder: `tsne_embedding.txt`, `umap_embedding.txt`
+ Visualisation of TSNE and UMAP: `TSNE_plot.pdf`, `UMAP_plot.pdf`
